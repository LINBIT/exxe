exxe  -  Execute commands indirectly
====================================

A shell-like utility that executes arbitrary commands read from standard input
and reports the results of those commands on standard output.  Results include
what commands write to their standard output and standard error, and the exit
status or signal that the command terminates with.  The utility is meant for
relatively short-running commands that produce moderate amounts of output; it
is not useful for commands whose output is processed as a stream of data.

The exxe utility can be run locally or remotely (for example, over ssh); this
can be useful for testing and automation.

For example, the following input:

	> hello world!
	! tr a-z A-Z

will execute the tr command and pass it a line of input; on success, the output
will be as follows:

	> HELLO WORLD!
	? 0

The exxe utility can be used in "client mode" to produce the appropriate input
for running a command, as well as for translating the output back into its
original form.  For example, the following command will produce the above
input:

	echo 'hello world!' | exxe -i tr a-z A-Z

and the following two commands will both produce the same result:

	echo 'hello world!' | tr a-z A-Z

	echo 'hello world!' | exxe -i tr a-z A-Z | exxe | exxe -o

See the test suite for more use cases.
